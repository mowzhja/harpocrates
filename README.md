# About
harpocrates is a university project for a Networking class.
It's a protocol (prototype) meant to allow secure one-on-one communication. It's written in Go and uses TCP sockets.

## Why the name?
[Harpocrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpocrates) was the god of silence, secrets and confidentiality.

## Why the change in language?
harpocrates was initially written in Rust, but I soon migrated the codebase to Go, simply because Go has a much better
cryptography library (integrated into std as well).
