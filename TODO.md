- [x] add error handler code to cerberus for both client and server that sends error messages in case of an error
- [x] watch for the cipher.Nonce() usage !!
- [x] build a further wrapper for writing and reading in cerberus so that it checks the nonce at every message
- [ ] test the connectivity through unit tests
- [ ] add logging to both client and server (bookmarks)
- [ ] Keep the code as free of external dependencies as possible (ideally everything should be in the stdlib)
- [ ] ? Add packet fragmentation => useless for now, but could be used to extend the functionality of harpocrates so that each fragment is sent over different networks, making it more resistent to interception and attack
