- [ ] Keep the code as free of external dependencies as possible (ideally everything should be in the stdlib)
- [x] Fix the the reading both server and client-side (buffer is too large)
    - [ ] Add a header to each packet to indicate the length of the whole thing and allocate the buffer based on that value (which is ideal, cause it supports messages of whatever size)
- [ ] Add packet fragmentation => useless for now, but could be used to extend the functionality of harpocrates so that each fragment is sent over different networks, making it more resistent to interception and attack
